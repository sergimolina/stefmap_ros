# stefmap_ros
STeF-map ROS implementation.
STeF-map is a time-dependent probabilistic map able to model and predict flow patterns of people in indoor environments. The proposed representation models the likelihood of motion direction on a grid-based map by a set of harmonic functions, which efficiently capture long-term variations of crowd movements over time [1].


There are two modalities to run the STeF-map: Online or Offline
- Online: the aim of this one is to create the STeF-map as at the same time the robot is gathering the people detections.
- Offile: this modality is useful when the data has been already gathered and we want to built the STeF-map manually (no need of active topics) using data from the past.

## Nodes:
### stefmap_node_online

#### Subscribed topics:
    /people_detections_1/2/3/4/5/6/7/8/9 (geometry_msgs/PoseArray)
        Topics providing the people detections used later to build the histograms in each time interval and update the STeF-map.
        
    /visibility_map (nav_msgs/OccupancyGrid)
         Map showing the coverage applying ray tracing using the /coverage_scan topic.
        Topic providing a map containg which cells of the environment are seen and which are not (Cells seen have a value of 100 and unseen cells have a value of 0). 
        The cells marked as seen are updated at the end of each time interval whether the was a human detection in them or not. 
        This is done to differenciate between cells that are seen but there was no detections and cells that are not seen and hence no data was available. 
        This topic can be computed with the "compute_visibility_map" node shown below. 
        Both the stefmap and the visibility map must have the same grid_size and dimensions (x_min, x_max, y_min, y_max) parameters.

#### Published topics:
    /stefmap (stefmap_ros/STeFMapMsg)
        This topic is published everytime the service ~get_stemap is called.

    ~get_stefmap (stefmap_ros/GetSTeFMap)
        It returns a STeF-map prediction given a time (unix) and the model order (frequency components to use to calculate the output). 
        An example on how obtain stefmap prediction can be found in: https://github.com/sergimolina/stefmap_ros/blob/master/src/stefmap_client_currenttime.py
